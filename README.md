# BetterPiP

## Project archived
Due to Firefox and Chrome now having their own picture-in-picture solutions, I've decided to archive this repo. Might still be helpful for learning how to utilize macOS PIP.framework.

## Original README.md
A macOS application that enables the use of native picture-in-picture with browsers such as Google Chrome for HTML5 videos.
